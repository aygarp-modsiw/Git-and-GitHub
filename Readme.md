Git is a free open-source version control system. It is used by most developers and programmers these days since this is easy and more efficient than other version control systems.

GitHub is a website that hosts your repositories online. Many people might get confused about this term, but it is just a service that holds your code in repositories. And by its name, we can guess that it is the hub for git. As a matter of fact, this is the largest open-source codebase for all users around the world.
